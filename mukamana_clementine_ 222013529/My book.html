			  <b>Introduction</b><br>
 <p>In this chapter I will be describing how powerful generalpurpose programming language was used to create the analyzed system. Under this chapter I will undergo full detail of how everything will function together with database that have been describe above and how it cope with full analyzed system.</p><br>
 
	<b>Tools used to develop this system in java programming</b><br>

<ol type="a"><li><p><b>Eclipse IDE:</b> an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development, and was the most popular. </p><br></li>

<li><p><b>JAR stands for Java Archive:</b>  It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating many files into one. Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and their requisite components. </p><br></li></ol>






<p><b>MySQL Connectors:</b> MySQL provides standards-based drivers for JDBC, ODBC, and .Net enabling developers to build database applications in their language.</p><br>
